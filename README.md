===============================

This is a replication of the classic arcade game, Frogger. 

The object of the game is to make it to the water without getting bit by the bugs.  

Use the arrow keys to move the player.  Be sure to dodge the bugs at all costs. 

If you collide with a bug, an alert will pop up to let you know. Click 'OK' and your player 
will return to the starting position. 

If you make it to the water, an alert will pop-up saying you've won.  Click 'OK' to return your 
player to the starting position. 

Have fun!
